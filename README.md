The analysis of transaction data provides valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior, product profitability, and the demographic segments that contribute the most to revenue. These findings can guide marketing strategies, promotional efforts, and product positioning.

The top three most profitable products based on total sales are **Dorito Corn Chip Supreme 380g**, **Smiths Crinkle Chip Original Big Bag 380g**, and **Smiths Crinkle Chips Salt & Vinegar 330g**. The **Dorito Corn Chip Supreme 380g** leads in total sales, indicating strong customer preference, likely due to its brand recognition and the larger pack size. **Smiths Crinkle Chip Original Big Bag 380g** follows closely behind, reinforcing the trend that larger pack sizes attract higher sales. **Smiths Crinkle Chips Salt & Vinegar 330g** also ranks among the highest-selling products, suggesting that strong and tangy flavors appeal to a wide customer base. The high sales volume of these products may be influenced by bulk purchasing habits, special promotions, or brand loyalty.

## Analysis of Customer Loyalty

When analyzing customer loyalty, it is evident that the most frequent and highest-spending customers belong primarily to the **older families** and **young families** life stages. Among them, **older families** appear most frequently in the top spenders list, spanning across **premium, mainstream, and budget** categories. A few customers from the **older singles/couples** life stage and young families also make significant contributions.

The highest-spending customer, identified by **loyalty card number 226000**, belongs to the **older families** life stage and falls under the **premium** category. This indicates that some premium customers make fewer but higher-value purchases. However, the majority of the most frequent purchasers are from the **budget segment**, particularly within **older families** and **young families**, which highlights their preference for affordability and bulk-buying options. 

Customers from the **mainstream segment**, especially older families, contribute significantly, showing a balance between affordability and brand preference. The presence of **young families** in both **budget and premium** categories suggests that this group values both cost-effectiveness and quality, depending on their purchasing power.

## Revenue Contribution by Customer Demographics

Revenue contribution by customer demographics provides further insights into which segments generate the highest sales. **Older families in the budget category emerge as the highest contributors to total revenue,** followed by **young singles and couples in the mainstream category** and **retirees in the mainstream category**. 

This indicates that **older families**, both in **premium and budget segments**, form a key target audience, possibly due to their need for consistent household consumption. Additionally, **retirees and young singles/couples** also contribute significantly, with spending habits shaped by lifestyle preferences and brand loyalty. **Older singles and couples** across budget, mainstream, and premium segments are also significant contributors, indicating that this group actively participates in snack purchases.

## Key Insights and Marketing Strategy Recommendations

These findings suggest that **bulk-pack snacks and well-known brands** are popular among high-revenue-generating segments. **Older families and budget-conscious customers** contribute significantly to total revenue, implying that marketing strategies should focus on **value-for-money deals, bulk purchases, and loyalty incentives**. 

The **mainstream customer base**, including **young singles/couples and retirees**, also plays a crucial role in sales, requiring tailored strategies to retain their engagement. Since **premium customers** appear less frequently in the highest revenue categories, there is an opportunity to develop specialized marketing campaigns targeting this group with **high-end, exclusive product offerings**.
